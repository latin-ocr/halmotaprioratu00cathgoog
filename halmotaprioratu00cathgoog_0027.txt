XX PREFAGE.

occasionally on payment 01 0 fine in addition to the
rent. Usually the rent of the demesnes was payable
at the Exchequer 01 the Prior in Durham, but as the
rent of the bondage tenements was occasionally directed
to be paid at the Exchequer, no inference 00 to the
nature 01 the tenure can be made from this circum-
stance. In East Rainton (p. 101) the demesnes are
demised to leur tenants for a term 01 years, under

and he pays a fine on entry. In the same vill (p. 104)
a bondage tenement is taken, with ten acres 01 the
demesnes, lor life, aud there are numerous other
instances where the demesne lands are taken with other

were at first demesne lands: per Ley Oh. 1., 2 Roll rep.

doubted whether all customary tenures 01000 descended.
Here, however, we may perhaps treee the transition
