xviii carrion:

and presentmeuts of those who were of this condition,
and where they were residing. The niefs were required
to do fealty in court, in proof ol their servile condition.
ln Billingham (p. 123) we have the form ol oath, “that
he will betrue to the Lord Prior and convent, and to
their servants in body and goods, and that he will not
take himself from their land.'' The niess who were in
possession ol boudage tenemeuts (houdupio) held, not
for life, as the other tenants‚ but ott the will of the lord,
and this variation from the usual form is usually ex-
plained in the roll, quic actious. Tenents so holding
at the will of the lord do not appear to have been sub-
ject to fines on entry (see under darrow, p. 84). It
seems, however, not to have been inconsistent with the
condition of a niel that he should hold of the Prior other
land for life. Thus we find John Yotsen, a uief of the
lord, taking a cottage and ten acres sor the term of his
life (Hesledon, p. 132), and again, under Billingham,
-Robert Yotson, the lord's niel, is similarly admitted.
Such of the hondagc tenements as were held for lile
were probably held by tenente hecheracti, who were not
of the condition of niess: under Billingham (p. 104)
and Oowpen (p. 79) we find instances of bondage tene·
ments so held. Niefs appear to have been sensitive of
their condition, for frequent injunctions against calling
them “rushes’' occur. In Wolveston we meet with an
injunction on all the tenants of the vill that none call
the lord’s niels rusticos under a penalty ol twenty
shillings, and in the Raintons (p. 33) the tenants are
even forbidden to call any one in those vills a niel,
under a similar penalty.
