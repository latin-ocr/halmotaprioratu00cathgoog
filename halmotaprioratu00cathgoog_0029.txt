autumn without food, or two days with food (p. 30).
The repairing of the lanes and of the mill being for
the common henefit of all, one would expect to find
the freeholders bearing their proportion, but the duty of

with twenty acres which he held freely by homage and
fealty, rendered his best beast as aheriot and nothing

heriot being rendered, which waS, therefore, probably
