rauraon. xvii

In the vills subject to the Halmote Oourt, the
rents were not fixed and certain during thc period
covered by this volume. The ancient (autiquuc)¹
rent was frequently increascd‚ and as frequently
abated, from which wc may infer at this period it
was in the nature of a rach-rent, and varied with thc
capabilities of the land or the circumstances of the
tenant. It varied from cd. to ls. peracre. In this
respect the tenants of the Bishop's mauors were ona
more favourable footing, as may bc seen in comparing
the rents and services of the bend-tenants, as recorded
inBoldon Buke and Hatfield's Survey. ln both Surveys
they are found the same, though two hundred years
intervened. But with regard to the money payments of
the Prior's tenants, it must be observed that careful con-
sideration appears to have been given to the circum-
stances and condition of the tonante, as the instances
are numerous where payment is allowed to be postponed
or abated. Under Spennymoor (p. 16) wc see an
allowance made to the widow ofa former tenant of half

the yearly rent on account of her age and weakness of
mind.

These tenants who were niefs (actiui) of the lord were,
in the language of the law-books, plebea adscripti, and
could not leave the vill without the lord’s lieenee. lf
they left the vill they required the lord's licence, and a
payment was made, pro albanam, ie. for the privilege
of living under another lord (see Shields‚ p. 185).

Hence we find frequent inquiries in the lord's court,

¹The word arrtiquus, however, (Sheles) we find Alice Morros ad·
may not necessarily imply the rent mouished to forsake her old habits
was of long standing. At p. 181 (antiquocmorce).
