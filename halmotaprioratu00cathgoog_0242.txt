¹ The grammar, or want cf grammar, in the Survey, is so peculim, that,
in delerence to ils writer, many contracted worda have been left eo, ce their
extension in the usual way might not have met with his approval. The
words have not been exlended where there was the slightest doubt aa
to whether singular cr plural was meant.

For convenience, especially ol comparison with the Burear’s Rental of
1539, the Roman numerals in sume have been supplied by Arabio figures.
