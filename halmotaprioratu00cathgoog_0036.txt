tenant had taken a crop of oats instead of beans or
peas. Trespasses, as might be expected, on the neigh-
bour's oorn, when the open-field system of cultivation
was in use, are frequent. Hirsill, or the obligation of

first to hard words and then to blows. Indeed, the
frequent orders upon the tenants not to transgress in
word or deed, or with stares, arrows or knives, and the
numerous fines for drawing knives to strike, and (though
less frequently) striking with knives, 'and the volu·

beer outside the vill and sell it within. In Shields
