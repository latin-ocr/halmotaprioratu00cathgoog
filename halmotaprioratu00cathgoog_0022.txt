(p. 10), William Maye took a 1011 and land, which Alan,

son of Peter, held, who during his life was to have lodg-
ing in the 1011, and three roods 01 land, in eaeh field
one rood. See also Monkton (p. 9). The widow invari-
ably succeeded in widow-right to the holding of her hus-
band 101 lile. The fine (persumet) on entry appears 10
have been certain, and not excessivo, and frequently was
remitted, in whole or in part. Without the lord's oon-
sent she could not marry again. Under Newton Bewley
(p. 59) awidow, admitted to two messuages and sixty
aerea, is prohibited from marrying again under a fine 01
four pounds. 11 she married she remained tenant, and
was responsible for the accustomed servieeS, but she,
with her husband, might surrender her tenement. Thus
under Ayeliffe (p. 23) we see John F ermour admitted to
a cottage which Emma, the wile 01 Gilbert Randolf‚ held,
and which they (Gilbert and Emma) then surrendered ;
and again, under East Rainton (p. 21), we find John
F reman admitted to his mother’s holding, whioh she and
Robert Thompson, who had married her, surrendered in
court to his use. After the widow's death perhaps
family considerations rather than eustom regulated the
right 10 admittanee. Under Billingham (p. 104) we
find the husband admitted to the holding 01 his late
wife3 but under Fulwell the son takes the holding of
his mother, and her husband undertakes to repair a
grange with a pair of “siles '’ and two “gavil fores” to
the eontentment 01 theson. 11 the widow did not wish
to hold her husband's tenement, his heir, or, in delault,
any 01 his blood, had the option 01 succeeding, 111111111-
ing these, the lord would admit any one willing to fine ;
