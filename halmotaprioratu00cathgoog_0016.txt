Oourt of the Prior and Oonvent, and commences with
the earliest roll extant, viz.‚ for the year 1296.

Besides affording much informationasto the conditione
on which the land was held, and the methods of its culti-
vation, they give us a vivid picture of the rural popula·
tion of the county of Durham during the period covered
by the rolls3 indeed, it is hardly a figure of speech to
say we have in them village life photographed. The
dry record of tenures is peopled by the men and women
who occupied them, whose acquaintance we make in
these records under the various phases of village life.
We see thern in their toste, surrounded by their orofts,
with their gardens of pot-herbs. We see how they
ordered the affairs of the village when summoned by
thc bailiff of the vill to consider matters which affected
the common weal of the community. We hear of their
trespasses and wrong-doings, and how they were
remedied or punished; of their strifes and contentions‚
and how they were repressed3 of their attempta, not
always ineffective, to grasp the principle of co-operation
as shown by their bye-laws; of their relations with the
Prior, who represented the convent and alone stood in
relation of lord. He appears always to have dealt with
his tenants, either in person or through his officers with
much consideration 3 and in the imposition of fines we
find thern invariably tempering justice with mercy.
But of their contenta, more presently.

The Oourt Rolls which are printed in the present
volume are preserved in the Treasury of the Dean and

Durhm, but now in the county of prised the ville of Euat and West
Nerthumberlnnd, and which com· Sleekburn,Camb0is,andBedlington.
