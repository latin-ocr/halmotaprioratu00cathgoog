serraca xix

One condition under which all the lord's tonants held
was that none could let or exchange their-holdings, in
whole or in part, without the lord’s licence. If this were
done without authority, the holding was seized into the
lord's hands, and the tenant would only be readmitted
on payment of afurther fine. In Wolveston (p. 68),
William Sergaunt we find so readmitted to a messuage
and fifteen acres, but the fine is allowed him, and he
has leave to let three acres in each field, one acre for
the term of his life. the liability to maintain and
leave in sufficient repair the buildings on their holdings
was strictly enjoined and enforced, though the lord
generally found timber for the purpose. If the tenant
left house, grangc, or other building out of repair, the
damages were assessed by tho jury, and the goods ol
the desaulting tenant arrested for making the necessary

reparati0n3 for a procceding of this nature see under

Dalton (p. 129).

lf there was a difficulty in finding a tenant, the
vacant holding would he assigned to those who were
of sufficient means to cultivate it ; thus we seo in
Pittington (p. 33) amessuage with twenty-eight auree,
assigned to two tenants, who are found by the jury
able (potentes) to hold it, and in Billingham (p. 45),
where the lands held by former tenants are assigned to
all the husbandmen ol the vill to answer for the rent;
also in Cowpen, where three acres, long lying waste, are
assigned to all the tenants ol the vill, until some tenant
should come who should be willing to take them.

The demesne lands of the vill or lordship were
demised at the lord's court, and the tenants admitted,
