The position of the free tenants with regard to the
Halmote Oourt is somewhat obscure, and the more so
when we find the free court having a kind 01 eon·
current jurisdiction. In Newton Ketton (p. 22) an
order is made 101 the attachment 01 J ohn Gilet, that he

his meadows with sixty pige, and for a reseue when
they were about to be impounded. Other attachments

(p. 104) the freeholders were charged with their
