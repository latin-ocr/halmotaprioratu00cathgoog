The Halmote Oourt appears to have been held three
times in each year, via, in the early spring, summer,
and autumn. In consequence of the legal year com·
mencing on the 25th March, the first turnus commenced
in the summer, the second in the autumn, and thc
third in the spring of the following year, according to
our rechoning. The Court is invariably called the
Court of the Prior, in whom were cmbodied the rights
and authority of the convent, and their consent cr
privity does not appear to have been required in the
Prior’s dealings with the tenants. The ninth statute
given for the regulation cf the Dean and Chapter soon
after their foundation seems to recognise the authority
which the Prior had in this matter to act independently
cf the convent: “Licebit tamen Decano, terrarum
visitatori. . . terras, tenemento, prata, pascuas, pis-
carias et decimas locare ct dimittere dc anno in annum,
et ad voluntatem domini (ut loquuntur) secundum
consuetudinem maneriorum ecclesiae praedictae, ctiam
aon requisito consensu capituli.''

The Steward, Bursar, and Terrar¹ (terrarius) appear
to have had equal authority in holding courts Some-
times wc find the court held before all three, and some-
times before two, of these three officials, but always
“with others,'' whose names are not mentioned.
